Since last months I've been developing a web app using CouchDB. The app was
suppose to be very simple and straight-forward at first glance, no complex
relation and structure. However while developing it, the things I thought easy
was not that case anymore with CouchDB, then one day I found out that MySQL has
pretty good `json` support, after a short time of experimenting what I planned
with this app, I was totally convinced by MySQL's new feature and decided to
migrate the data layer, and I have to say the experience was way beyond my
expectation in a good way :)
